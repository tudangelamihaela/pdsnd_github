### Project Title: Programmin for Data Science with Python Nanodegree - Udacity


### Description
This repository contains projects for Udacity Nanodegree - Programming for Data Science with Python. There were three different training sections to perform and for each section we needed to work on a Project and submit it:

*** Project 1 ***

For the fisrt project we needed to explore a database of available movie rentals, create and execute SQL queries, and create visualizations to display the results of these queries.

The project included also a presentation where we were required to create four slides containing:

 - How many movies were rented per each genre?
 - How many movies were rented per each genre?
 - How many movies were rented in July and August 2005 for the first two stores?
 - Total pay amount per customer for 2007
 
*** Project 2 ***

In this assignment we needed to used Python to investigate data pertaining to bike share programs in three cities of America: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. We were required to create code that would:

 - import the data and compute descriptive statistics to answer questions about the data
 - write a script that would accept raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to display these statistics.
